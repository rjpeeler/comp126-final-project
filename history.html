        <p>Tuesday Night Worship (TNW) is a weekly student-led gathering that has brought believers together at UNC Chapel Hill since 2010. Every Tuesday night, students from across campus unite to worship Jesus, encourage one another, and fellowship. Though entirely organized and led by students each year, TNW has been supported by different campus ministers. Currently, TNW is supported by Michael Pham, founder of Wellspring Campus Ministry. Michael has ministered at UNC’s campus for over 10 years!</p>
        <p>Over the years, Tuesday Night Worship has played a powerful role in uniting the larger Christian community at UNC. Students from a wide variety of ministries and campus fellowships come together, laying aside denominational differences to worship as one family. What began as a simple desire among students to praise Jesus has grown into a movement that continues to shape spiritual life on campus and foster unity.</p>
        <p>At its core, Tuesday Night Worship exists to glorify God, build community, and create space for the students to worship in the midst of a busy schedule, all in the name of Jesus.</p>
